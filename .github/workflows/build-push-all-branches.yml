### Release-* methodology originally authored by Nathan Freeman (TACC) here:
### https://github.com/tapis-project/tapis-workflows/blob/prod/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L59
# Description. This Github action runs when there are new commits to dev, stage, or release-*.
# The action logs into Docker with the Github action environment secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
# and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`.
# The action pulls the repo and builds the tapis/pods-api image and uses branch name as the
# docker tag. In instance of `release-1.2.0`, sed will delete `release-`, leaving `1.2.0`.
# If branch = prod, tag becomes `prod, tapis/pods-api:latest` so prod and latest are built.
#
# NOVEMBER 29th:
